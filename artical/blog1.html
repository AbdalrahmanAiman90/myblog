    <article style="font-size: 20px;color: azure;"> is a programming language?
        A programming language, at its core, is a set of syntactical rules. These rules instruct a computer to perform
        specific tasks. Each programming language has its own set of keywords it understands. These help it organize
        instructions. Just the same way as with human language, we use programming languages to communicate with
        computers.

        Programming languages come in two main types: low-level and high-level.

        Low-level programming languages
        Low-level programming languages are your 0s and 1s. A processor can run these languages directly without a
        compiler or interpreter. These languages are very fast for this reason, but can be hard for humans to
        understand.

        High-level programming languages
        That’s why high-level programming languages exist. These languages are more user-friendly and readable for
        humans. They need a compiler or interpreter to translate the language into machine language.

        Examples of high-level programming languages are Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP and Swift.

        What is Turing complete?
        Turing completeness is a concept from theoretical computer science. People use it to define what is and is not a
        programming language. It tells you how powerful a programming language is.

        The name Turing comes from Alan Turing, who invented the Turing machine back in the 1930s. His machine could
        take a program and run it, then show a result. At first he had to create different machines for different
        programs. This was obviously not ideal, so he created a “Universal Turing Machine”, which can take any program
        and run it.

        You can think of programming languages like these machines. They take instructions (programs) and run them. A
        programming language is considered “Turing complete”, if it can run any program that a Turing machine could run,
        given enough time and memory.
