        High-level programming languages
        That’s why high-level programming languages exist. These languages are more user-friendly and readable for
        humans.
        They need a compiler or interpreter to translate the language into machine language.

        Examples of high-level programming languages are Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP and Swift.

        What is Turing complete?
        Turing completeness is a concept from theoretical computer science.
        People use it to define what is and is not a programming language. It tells you how powerful a programming
        language is.

        The name Turing comes from Alan Turing, who invented the Turing machine back in the 1930s.
        His machine could take a program and run it, then show a result. At first he had to create different machines
        for different programs. This was obve

        You can think of programming languages like these machines. They take instructions (programs) and run them. A
        programming language is considered “Turing complete”,
        if it can run any program that a Turing machine could run, given enough time and memory.
